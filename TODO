Fix WCS stuff
Save path and filename across Prosp restarts (in Andor.py?)
Move optical coupler to Andor.py server
Move fitstime.coords.py into Prosp (or use it externally) to add JD header in Andor.py
Use async call to GetFits so the status file doesn't go for long periods without being updated.
reduce crashes if imsex doesn't return a fwhm,sky tuple
Prosp fails due to comms missing for long exposures
gord() never exits
Multiple instance of Prosp fails if one is taking an image - getFits returns None?

Add cancel exposure method so server doesn't keep taking long images
